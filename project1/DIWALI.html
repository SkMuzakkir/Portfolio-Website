        Good morning everyone presents here.
        Today I’m here to deliver my speech on Diwali.
        Diwali is one of India’s biggest and main festival.
        The meaning of Diwali is rows of lighted lamps.
        This festival is the festival of lights. <BR>
        Hindus celebrate it with very much joy.
        In this festival, people light up their houses with Diyas.
        People worship Lord Ganesh and Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and wisdom.<BR>
        Diwali is most likely the brightest festival in the world. People of various religions celebrate Diwali.
        Most significant, that this festival signifies the victory of light over darkness. This also indicates the
        victory of good over evil and knowledge over ignorance. There are bright lights all over the whole country
        during Diwali. In my speech on Diwali, we will know the religious and spiritual importance of it.<BR>

    <FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic" SIZE=15 COLOR=WHITE>The religious importance of this festival has many differences.
        It varies from one region to other regions in India. There is a link-up of many deities, cultures, and
        traditions with Diwali.<BR>
        The reason for these differences is possibly local harvest festivals. Therefore, there was a blend of these
        harvest festivals into one pan-Hindu festival.<BR>

        The main reason to celebrate Diwali is also to return to Lord Ayodhya of Lord Ram. After he defeated Ravana, the
        Asur king of Lanka. So every year on this day we celebrate it as a symbol of goodness. The lord Rama with his
        wife Sita and younger brother Laxman came back to Ayodhya.<BR> They spent 14 years of exile in the forest.

        The folks of Ayodhya express their affection and attachment to their king by heartfelt welcome. They lighted up
        their houses and the whole state with light. In this way, they welcomed Raja Rama. <BR>

        There is another popular custom for the reason of Diwali. Here Lord Vishnu as an avatar of Krishna killed
        Narakasura.<BR> Narakasura was a demon. Above all, this victory took the release of 16000 captive girls.
        Moreover, this victory is an indication of the victory of good over evil.<BR> This is because of Lord Krishna
        being good and Narakasura being evil.

        Association of Diwali to Goddess Lakshmi is the faith of many Hindus. Lakshmi is the Goddess of wealth and
        prosperity. According to a legend, Diwali is the night of Lakshmi’s marriage.<BR> In eastern India, Hindus
        relate Diwali with Goddess Durga or Kali. Some Hindus have faith in Diwali to be the start of a new year.<BR>
